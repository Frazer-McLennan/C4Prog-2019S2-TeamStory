The Story so far....

Once upon a time in a un8iverse far awy (well any universe is going to be far away from this reality), there lived a unicorn.

Their (gender unspecific) name is Ewenee.

Ewenee was sat in their beautiful pink grass that was being fanned by a gentle breeze...

They contemplated a strange, unidentified animal playing with rocks

The animal that they saw resembled a giant Flamingo But with rediculously small wings compared to its size

Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and Ewenee hid under a nearby tree.

They were the first being who played dotes...
